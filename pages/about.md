# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

Well travelled, personable, good at listening, and quick to learn new things: I am a software engineer, GIS analyst, (and amateur sculptor!), with 15 years of software-dev experience, and 2 master’s degrees, starting a PhD at the University of Calgary under the direction of <a target="_blank" href="https://geog.ucalgary.ca/profiles/victoria-fast">Dr. Victoria Fast </a>. I work part-time as a Research Associate, and also volunteer on the Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) committee as the graduate representative.

My research focus is on accessibility and disability barriers in the built environment. I’m leveraging conceptual frameworks in social justice, technologies such as GIS, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, and LiDAR to complete automated citywide accessibility evaluations that are free from disability and inclusion biases.

It is a subject close to me: When I was younger, I almost lost my legs, and I prepared myself for this seeming eventuality for almost a decade. The experience left me with a deep appreciation for the everyday courage of people who choose to go on, no matter their challenges or lack of equity.
