# GEOG-639 > Adv Spatial Analysis & Modeling

I'm working as a teaching assistant this semester (Winter 2024) for the excellent Dr. Bertazzon, and I'm getting to the opportunity to revisit the course material after finishing my MGIS degree last summer. 

I'm really appreciating the TA experience because of how it involves more than just understanding the material, it is also deepening my understanding because I also need to explain it in a complemetary way to the course materials in a way that engages in an applied way. 

I'll be posting occational fun insights in small blog posts that you find in the blog section of my site.
