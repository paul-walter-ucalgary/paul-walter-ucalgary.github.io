# GEOG-588 > Urban GIS via Experiential Learning

### Total Redesign!

I am TA'ing for [GEOG-588 Urban GIS](https://geog.ucalgary.ca/manageprofile/courses/w24/GEOG588) being taught by my PhD advisor [Dr. Victoria Fast](https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/victoria-fast), and she has *completely* redesigned the course to focus on experiential learning which presents guest-experts from industry to come and pose design-challenge questions to our students. 

### Why it is exciting

It is proving to be an exciting course because of the ground breaking, experiential approach being used: she is inviting some great local experts to come talk to the class as and pose urban design questions to the students, to challenge them to think creatively and create solutions that they've developed.

### My Role

As TA, my role is 1) support Dr. Fast's new approach, and 2) help catalyze student innovation by conducting labs where students will develop their self-directed projects help students more deeply understand the course materials (and trouble shoot any technical issues they might have with GIS, Programming, or acquiring useful data.)

I'll be posting occasional insights in small blog posts that you find in the blog section of my site.

Here is the university's [official course-description](https://geog.ucalgary.ca/manageprofile/courses/w24/GEOG588):

    GEOG 588: URBAN GIS (WINTER 2024)
    
    Surveys GIS applications for urban studies, and the data structures, sources, and analysis techniques used in them. Explores urban spatial analysis, decision-making in a GIS environment, and representational challenges, including project planning, spatial data acquisition, data preparation and coding, analysis and visualization of project findings, and communication and implementation of project results.
